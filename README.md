👋 Hi visitor! 

My nickname is GibbZ (@GibbZ-78 within the Github environment though...).  
I’m always interested 👀 in learning and developing new competencies such as :
- foreign languages
- coding
- entrepreneurship
- etc.

I am currently working on an entrepreneurial project for which I need to improve my web development skills.  
🌱 As such, from January to July 2022, I'll be attending the 24-week bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (aka THP - https://www.thehackingproject.org/).  
Once "upgraded" + my project clearer, I'll surely be looking to collaborate 💞️ on the design & coding of the related platform + smart concierge bot I wanna attach to it!

Meanwhile, 📫 You can reach me via Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanbaptistevidal/ and hence discover (part of) my true identity :smirk:.

Fun fact :zap: about me: I have :wrench: designed and built :nut_and_bolt: an 8x4x2-meter sk8 & roller wood ramp in my garden

Have a nice day, wanderer!
