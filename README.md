👋 Hi visitor! 

My nickname is **GibbZ** (OK, @GibbZ-78 within the Github environment though... Some namesake apparently existing).  
I’m always interested 👀 in learning and developing new skills such as :
- foreign languages
- coding
- wood craftsmanship and other DIY topics
- entrepreneurship
- sports
- etc.

I am currently working on an entrepreneurial project 🚀 🦄 for which I notably needed to update my web development skills 🥇 and improve 💪 my knowledge of modern frameworks (rails, react, node...). To do so, from January to July 2022, I have attended the 24-week bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (aka THP - Visit  https://www.thehackingproject.org/ for details).  
Now "upgraded" and my project made clearer, I am focusing :microscope: on the design and coding of the related platform + smart concierge bot 🤖 I wanna attach to it!

Meanwhile, you can reach me 📫 via Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanbaptistevidal/ and hence discover (part of) my true identity 😏.

Fun facts ⚡ about me: I have designed :wrench: and built :nut_and_bolt: an 8x4x2-meter sk8 & roller wood ramp in my garden, and I recently started to convert a van 🚐 into my future tiny confy family resort on wheels 🚚🏡.

Have a nice day, wanderer 👽!
